# General Relativity Playground

You can play with general relativity [here](https://potocpav.github.io/general-relativity/).

## Run

```sh
npx browser-sync start --server
```

## Plan

Infra:

- [x] Find a basis project, clone & adapt it
- [x] Publish to GH Pages
- [ ] Link to GitHub
- [ ] Improve menus

Raytracing:

- [x] Minkowski metric
- [x] Observer motion
- [x] Geodesics in polar coordinates in Minkowski metric
- [x] Raytracing in curved coordinates

Black hole:

- [x] Schwarzschield metric for observer
- [x] Schwarzschield metric for light
- [ ] Orbiting around a black hole
- [ ] Use a precise solver
- [ ] Traversable event horizon
- [ ] Redshift
- [ ] Light attenuation

Test objects, interaction:

- [ ] Display objects
- [ ] Compute object trajectories
- [ ] Interactive spaceship control
- [ ] Interactive object spawning
- [ ] Time controls
- [ ] Scenario presets
- [ ] Automatically generate floaters

## Acknowledgements

I learned general theory of relativity from online lectures by Prof. Petr Kulh√°nek from CTU in Prague. Many thanks to him for skillfully balancing simplicity and completeness.

Amazing WebGL code and HTML template from Mr.doob was used as the basis of this project.
