# General Relativity Playground

You can play with general relativity [here](https://potocpav.github.io/general-relativity/).

## Run

```sh
npx browser-sync start --server
```

## Plan

Infra:

- [x] Find a basis project, clone & adapt it
- [x] Publish to GH Pages
- [x] Refactor to use classes & files
- [x] Link to GitHub
- [ ] Improve menus

Raytracing:

- [x] Minkowski metric
- [x] Observer motion
- [x] Geodesics in polar coordinates in Minkowski metric
- [x] Raytracing in curved coordinates
- [x] Fix Lorentz Boost with non-orthonormal local coords
- [x] Gravitational redshift
- [x] Doppler redshift
- [x] Object redshift
- [x] Light attenuation
- [x] Relativistic beaming
- [x] Object relativistic beaming
- [ ] Correct redshift visualization
- [ ] HDR
- [ ] Bloom

Black hole:

- [x] Schwarzschild metric for observer
- [x] Schwarzschild metric for light
- [x] Use a precise solver for photons
- [x] Use a precise solver for motion
- [x] Orbiting around a black hole test
- [ ] Traversable event horizon

Test objects, interaction:

- [x] Display objects
- [x] Object dynamics
- [x] Correct length contractions for objects
- [x] Compute object trajectories
- [x] Interactive spaceship control
- [x] Interactive object spawning
- [ ] Time controls
- [ ] Control effects (redshift, beaming, etc.)
- [ ] Scenario presets
- [ ] Automatically generate floaters
- [ ] Spatial indexing of object trajectories to improve performance of multiple objects

Scenario ideas:

- Twin paradox
- Gravitational time dilation
- Light clocks
- Light curving around massive objects
- Falling into black hole, trying to fight gravity
- Visiting a planet close to supermassive BH
- Relativistic beaming & redshift (semaphore?)
- Objects falling into BH, accretion disc
- Expanding space-time?
- Gaining energy from Kerr hole

I learned general theory of relativity from online lectures by Prof. Petr Kulh√°nek from CTU in Prague. Many thanks to him for skillfully balancing simplicity and completeness.

Amazing WebGL code and HTML template from Mr.doob was used as the basis of this project.
